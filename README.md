# Arduino Portenta Bare Metal Programming in STM32CubeIDE

### Intro
I was looking for a very powerful controller to use for some work related projects.
The Portenta was released in 2020 with not a lot of documentation at the beggining, but the high density connectors on the back were a great way to integrate this board into any PCB. But I do not beleive the Arduino platform is ideal for professional/industrial applications, and with this I began reverse engineering the PCB and all the initialization code it requires.
